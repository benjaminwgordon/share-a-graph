	Story:
		name:
		description:
		blurb: 
		tags: []
		postCharLimit: 
		postLimit: 
		content: [ref:Post] 
		Authors: [ref:User]		
	
	User:
		authoredStories: [ref:Story]
		authoredPosts: [ref:Post]
		name:
		link: 
        img: 
		upvotes: [ref:Post]
		downvotes: [ref:Post]

	Post:
		author: {ref:User}
		body: String
		upvotes: Number
		downvotes: Number
		

User Stories:

	#1: Here to browse:
		I create an account, but dont publish anything to my profile
		I want to see whats available, consume content, and vote on stories I like
		I filter the search by genres I enjoy, and browse the story names/blurbs to 
			find content to read
		When I read stories, when I find a post I enjoy, I upvote, and when I reach the
			end of a story, I vote on whether I want it to continue or not

	#2: Here to write (free model user):
		I make an account, and publish some non-identifying info on my profile
		I want to contribute to stories
		I want to be a popular writer, but not recognized by my real name
		I want to stay generally anonymous (at least writing under a pseudonym)
		I browse and read stories, especially keeping up with stories I have posted on
			which I can access through the sidebar for liked stories
		
		
	#3: Here to advertise (premium model):
		I make an account with self-advertising info 
		I'm a writer/prompter and my primary goal is self-promotion
		I want to be a popular writer to advertise my real name
		I want to write under my name, and advertise my published works
		I create a profile, with a picture, links to my personals, and links to my available
			published works
		I write lots of posts, especially continuing to post on stories I have already posted in
			which I access through the sidebar for "continue writing"
